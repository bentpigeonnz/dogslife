# SECURITY POLICY

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in dogsLife, **please do NOT create a public issue**. Instead, email our security team at [security@dogslife.com] or use the private GitHub security advisory.

We aim to acknowledge and respond to all security reports within 48 hours.

## Supported Versions

- Latest release (main branch)
- All active LTS branches

## Best Practices

- Keep dependencies updated.
- Never expose secrets in code, issues, or PRs.
- All sensitive features (auth, roles, payments) must have code review by a project maintainer.

## Responsible Disclosure

All disclosures will be kept confidential until a fix is released. Weâ€™ll credit researchers (if desired) in the `CHANGELOG.md`.
